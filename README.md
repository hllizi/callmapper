# CallMapper

Sometimes it may be useful to have the same interface of bool-valued methods for certain objects and collections of such objects, where the method called on the collection returns true if the same method returns true if called on some object in the collection, i.e. if some object in the collection has the encoded property. The CallMapper class and the CallMapIterator trait help facilitate implementing such parallel interfaces.

Further documentation forthcoming.
